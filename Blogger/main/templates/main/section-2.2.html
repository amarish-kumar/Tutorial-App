    Open terminal and navigate to .NET Core project directory or use last opened console and then type 
    `<i>ng new ClientApp --minimal --dry-run</i>`. We use
    `<i>--mininal</i>`
    flag to generate all support tools but project itself to be minimal as possible. This
    `<i>--dry-run</i>`
    showing what you should expect to create when command is executed without dry flag, but it's convenient for sanity check.

    When see this minimal template it's ready to install but if you see more files, directories or many other things you should probably
    check that
    `<i>--minimal</i>` flag is not misspeled. If everything is correct then type again command without
    `<i>--dry-run</i>` flag
    `<i>ng new &lt;Name Of Client App&gt; --minimal</i>`, you should wait until npm install Angular and all dependencies.
    When all is done client app should have same or very similar project structure.

<p>Looks more complicated than it is, but we must fix that a bit later.</p>

<p>
    Switch in console that is already on project path and type 
    `<i>cd &lt;Name Of Client App&gt;</i>`
     and letâ€™s use another command
     `<i>ng build</i>`
     thath gets all Typescript files you produce along with angular code and use Webpack to bundle all chunks as we can see below.

<p>
    This bundles are ready for injecting, we need all of them. If you curious, your code spots in "<strong>main.bundle.js</strong>"  and all other
    are rest of your app (styles, angular code, etc.). All bundles location is "<strong>(Name Of Client App)/dist</strong>"
</p>

<p>
    Again just for sanity check let's test our client app without messing it up with server code as typing on terminal that is already in path
    "<strong>(Main Project)/(Client Project)</strong>" and serve client app as execute
    `<i>ng serve</i>` then you see

<p>
    our client app runs alone on localhost in port 4200. Locate your browser there
    <a href="localhost:4200">localhost:4200</a> and if you follow along you should see that everything runs without errors and all bundles is spit
    in browser properly.

    If everything is fine so far we can proceed with next section namely integrating two projects run like one application.
