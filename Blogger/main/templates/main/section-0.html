        Before beginning this tutorial, I want to share some thoughts about why somebody would like to integrate these two technologies
        by hand.
        <br> When people use ready to-go templates they don't necessary need all of the modules files and other parts of application
        that is auto-generated, most likely they don't like deciphering whole bunch of files or code that should be judged
        to remain or not.
        <br> Whole process of exploring project folders, files and code is method that I prefer before go to code, that's why
        I decide to create tutorial for people that like to understand whole structure and every detail in startup project,
        from there gradually integrating whole idea.
        <br> When I start new application I like to go from minimalistic type of structure and from almost empty project incorporating
        templates, files, etc. that application really need because creating whole code and structure itself.
