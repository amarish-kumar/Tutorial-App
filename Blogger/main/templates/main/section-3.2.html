<p>
    Switch to your IDE or text editor select "<strong>Startup</strong>" class and delete all distracting boilerplate code and comments that you don't
    need like screenshot below.

    This is much cleaner.
</p>

<p>
    You must configure .NET Core
    <!-- TOOLTIP -->

    to add static files into pipeline, to do that we use
    "<strong>Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles</strong>" library and then call extension method
    "<strong>UseStaticFiles</strong>".

<p>
    By default .NET Core looking in "<strong>wwwroot</strong>" folder that is already created for you from project template in beginning of the tutorial.
</p>

<p>
    Lets test use of current root as go to "<strong>wwwroot</strong>" and create new html file like on screenshot below in my case
    "<strong>test.html</strong>" with pure text for testing purpose.
</p>

<p>
    Then start terminal(in my case I use vscode integrated terminal, see above screenshot) go to project folder and type
    `<i>dotnet run</i>`, like before dotnet will run local server and start listening for requests on port 5000 and from there our pipeline should have acces to "<strong>test.html</strong>" file. 
</p>
<p>
    On browser when we navigate url to file name (in my case url is <a href="localhost:5000/test.html">localhost:5000/test.html</a>)
    we see that the content appear on screen also files are properly injected and last but not least our console has no red lines
    (no errors).
</p>

<p>
    Here is our html file when we open network tab.
</p>

<p>
    If you follow along with me and everything is fine so far go to "<strong>wwwroot</strong>" folder and delete "<strong>test.html</strong>" file.
</p>

<p>
    Next we should setup typescript and angular-cli configurations to sync with new changes on projects structure that we made,
    then serve webpack bundles in our public root because they had to be accesible from client browser.
